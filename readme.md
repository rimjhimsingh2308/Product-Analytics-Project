📊 Exploratory Data Analysis – User Retention & Engagement

This project analyzes user retention, engagement, and conversion behavior from a dataset of 5,000 user signups.
The work is structured into three main parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – identifying anomalies, retention patterns, and feature usage.

2. Problem Identification & Solutions – linking findings to key business goals.

3. Presentation – communicating results, business impact, and actionable recommendations.
